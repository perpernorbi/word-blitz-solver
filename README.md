# Word Blitz solver

This is a simple program to print out the solutions for the game Word Blitz. I am not going to put much effort in this. My goal was to beat Gabi in this game. I case you are curious, the program works correctly, but she is still beating me in every round.

Update: Add period in front of a letter to mark, that it is a special one. Still, lost one round against her. Also capital letters are treat as special.
